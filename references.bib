The aim of the Text Creation Partnership was to create fully searchable XML-encoded transcriptions of the image sets of early printed books which form the basis for ProQuest's Early English Books Online. The Bodleian Libraries and the Oxford Internet Institute sought and received funding from JISC under their Digital Preservation and Curation programme for the SECT: Sustaining the EEBO-TCP Corpus in Transition project. The first stage of the SECT project was to carry out a benchmarking study of the impact and use of EEBO-TCP, using the OII’s Toolkit for the Impact of Digital Scholarly Resources (TIDSR), itself a JISC-funded initiative. The study concentrated primarily on the use and impact of EEBO-TCP in the UK. This report outlines the results of the TIDSR study, which will be used as a basis for the creation of practical recommendations for improvements to EEBO-TCP, focussing on how best to secure the long-term sustainability of the corpus.},

EEBO began its life as a mirofilm archive produced beginning in 1940: a massive book-copying project was undertaken during World War II to protect rare books from German bombs. These reproductions were made largely by unnamed woman archivists and led by a team of woman photographers, academics, and secretaries. In this essay, I draw on existing theories and histories of EEBO while highlighting these women's work, which manifests in the photographs through the shadows of the fingertips they used to pin down the fragile books. This archive of reproductive labor exemplifies the artificial divide between auteur and stenographer, artist and secretary, that animated many of the early twentieth century’s avant-garde movements, including ones in which EEBO photographers were intimately involved. The fingers represent the custodial labor of women working across artistic and administrative modes during World War II and the decades that followed.},

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Two that are regularly suggested as candidates are “data” and “document.” Oddly, perhaps, for such a basic term, “data” has not been as frequently subject to probing analysis in the scholarly literature as “information”; and although “document” has long been a term of special interest to historians of the European documentation movement, some of whom continue to develop a document theory, there is little consensus on the precise nature of the conceptual relationship between “data” and “document.” In this paper, a review is conducted of historical interpretations of “data,” and relationships with contemporary conceptions of “document” are explored. The conclusion is reached that, current practice notwithstanding, it is not in fact the case that documents are made up of data, nor that the document is a species of dataset: rather it is the other way round, in both respects. A dataset is made up of documents; and the dataset is a species of document.},

Though Close Reading with Computers focuses on but one novel, it has a crucial exemplary function: author Martin Paul Eve demonstrates a set of methods and provides open-source software tools that others can use in their own literary-critical practices. In this way, the project serves as a bridge between users of digital methods and those engaged in more traditional literary-critical endeavors.},

The ability to access and organize information and people has been profoundly liberating in some online contexts, but social media also presents many issues which come to light in the often-overlapping domains of politics, media studies, and disinformation. While these countervailing influences are all around us, the essays collected in this volume represent a humanistic ethics of generosity, compassion, and care. Social knowledge creation refreshingly returns to humanist values, emphasizing that people matter more than networks, facts matter more than opinion, and ideas matter more than influence. As a result, the speed and scale of digital culture has challenged humanists from many disciplines to more clearly define the values of education, collaboration, and new knowledge in pursuit of human justice and equality. In short, online culture has presented a new opportunity to define how and why the humanities matter in the age of social media.},

Student-friendly and accessible, the book advances this argument through case studies drawn from the Early English Books Online corpus. Gavin shows how a copublication network of printers and authors reveals an uncannily accurate picture of historical periodization; that a vector-space semantic model parses historical concepts in incredibly fine detail; and that a geospatial analysis of early modern discourse offers a surprising panoramic glimpse into the period's notion of world geography. Across these case studies, Gavin challenges readers to consider why corpus-based methods work so effectively and asks whether the successes of formal modeling ought to inspire humanists to reconsider fundamental theoretical assumptions about textuality and meaning. As Gavin reveals, by embracing the expressive power of mathematics, scholars can add new dimensions to digital humanities research and find new connections with the social sciences.},

Starting with Heminges and Condell's designations of the Folio plays as comedies, histories, and tragedies, the authors offer a portrait of Shakespearean genre at the sentence level, showing how identifying frequently iterated word combinations (in either their presence or absence) allows new ways to study the integrity and fluidity of Shakespeare's genres. Calling this approach 'iterative criticism,' they situate their critical practice within both Shakespearean criticism and humanities-centered protocols of reading, concluding with a genre map of Shakespeare's plays compared to nearly three hundred other early modern dramas. Hope and Witmore do not seek to replace subjective, humanistic reading with something more 'objective.' Rather, they use digital, iterative methods in order to be 'consistently subjective' - to extend interpretative strategies across quantities of texts and frequencies of feature that could otherwise not be accommodated.},

Roles should be automatically determined from the data, and could be, for example, "clique-members," "periphery-nodes," etc. Roles enable numerous novel and useful network-mining tasks, such as sense-making, searching for similar nodes, and node classification. This paper addresses the question: Given a graph, how can we automatically discover roles for nodes? We propose RolX (Role eXtraction), a scalable (linear in the number of edges), unsupervised learning approach for automatically extracting structural roles from general network data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RolX on several network-mining tasks: from exploratory data analysis to network transfer learning. Moreover, we compare network role discovery with network community discovery. We highlight fundamental differences between the two (e.g., roles generalize across disconnected networks, communities do not); and show that the two approaches are complimentary in nature.},

However, the performance of these tools is often unsatisfactory, due to language change and genre differences. Spelling normalization heuristics are the dominant solution for dealing with historical texts, but this approach fails to account for changes in usage and vocabulary. In this empirical paper, we assess the capability of domain adaptation techniques to cope with historical texts, focusing on the classic benchmark task of part-of-speech tagging. We evaluate several domain adaptation methods on the task of tagging Early Modern English and Modern British English texts in the Penn Corpora of Historical English. We demonstrate that the Feature Embedding method for unsupervised domain adaptation outperforms word embeddings and Brown clusters, showing the importance of embedding the entire feature space, rather than just individual words. Feature Embeddings also give better performance than spelling normalization, but the combination of the two methods is better still, yielding a 5\% raw improvement in tagging accuracy on Early Modern English texts.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

However, investigating at scale requires different approaches to scholarship: it is not practical to close-read tens of thousands of texts. To make the most of these new resources, we must integrate traditional literary scholarship with new approaches. This chapter gives an example of such a combined approach. We consider the language of 554 printed plays from the Early Modern period. We explore two research questions: (a) is there a distinct ‘language of tragedy’? (b) is there a distinctively Shakespearean language of tragedy? We aim to show how computational and traditional literary techniques can be combined to answer these questions.},

A major new contribution to attribution studies, the Authorship Companion illuminates the work and methodology underpinning the groundbreaking New Oxford Shakespeare and casts new light on the professional working practices, and creative endeavors, of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. We now know that Shakespeare collaborated with his literary and dramatic contemporaries and that others adapted his works before they reached printed publication. The Authorship Companion's essays explore and explain these processes, laying out everything we currently know about the works' authorship. Using a variety of different attribution methods, The New Oxford Shakespeare has confirmed the presence of other writers' hands in plays that until recently were thought to be Shakespeare's solo work. Taking this process further with meticulous, fresh scholarship, essays in the Authorship Companion show why we must now add new plays to the accepted Shakespeare canon and reattribute certain parts of familiar Shakespeare plays to other writers. The technical arguments for these decisions about Shakespeare's creativity are carefully laid out in language that anyone interested in the topic can understand. The latest methods for authorship attribution are explained in simple but accurate terms and all the linguistic data on which the conclusions are based is provided.The New Oxford Shakespeare consists of four interconnected publications: the Modern Critical Edition (with modern spelling), the Critical Reference Edition (with original spelling), a companion volume on authorship, and an online version integrating all of this material on OUP's high-powered scholarly editions platform.

Recent and ongoing digital humanities projects are now considering networks with fresh approaches and increasingly complex datasets. At the heart of these digital projects are ‘network ontologies’ — functional data models for distilling the complicated, messy connections between historical people, objects, and places. Although scholars creating network ontologies necessarily focus on different types of content, if these networks are to form a coherent body of scholarship in the future, we must work towards the creation of interoperable ontological structures, rather than yet another set of competing standards. Here we examine the methodological considerations behind designing such interoperable ontologies, focusing primarily on the example of Early Modern historical networks. We argue that it would be infeasible to adopt a single ontological standard for all possible digital humanities projects; flexibility is essential to accommodate all subjects and objects of humanistic enquiry, from the micro-level to the longue-durée. However, we believe it possible to establish shared practices to structure these network ontologies on an ongoing basis in order to ensure their long-term interoperability.},

By adapting the methodology recently developed by Ruth Ahnert and Sebastian E. Ahnert to analyse Protestant letter networks memorialised in Foxe's Acts and Monuments, this article uses digital and visual tools to assess the importance of female involvement in the Hartlib Circle. It examines how integral female members were to the information flow of this network and the degree to which their positions in the network granted them influence over other members. Through this computational approach, this article also challenges the view that at its core the Hartlib Circle was made up of a group of male friends, arguing that Dorothy Moore Dury and Katherine Jones, Viscountess Ranelagh need to be recognised as integral elements of this network's core.},

These measures and algorithms reveal certain expected trends, such as the fact that many of the Marian martyrs featuring in John Foxe’s famous “Book of Martyrs” were central to the organization of this network by every measure. But they also reveal the surprising importance of letter couriers and financial supporters to the survival of this community during a time of intense persecution.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel computational approach to automatically analyze the physical process behind printing of early modern letterpress books via clustering the running titles found at the top of their pages. Specifically, we design and compare custom neural and feature-based kernels for computing pairwise visual similarity of a scanned document’s running titles and cluster the titles in order to track any deviations from the expected pattern of a book’s printing. Unlike body text which must be reset for every page, the running titles are one of the static type elements in a skeleton forme i.e. the frame used to print each side of a sheet of paper, and were often re-used during a book’s printing. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we manually annotate the running title clusters on about 1600 pages across 8 early modern books of varying size and formats. Our method can detect potential deviation from the expected patterns of such skeleton formes, which helps bibliographers understand the phenomena associated with a text’s transmission, such as censorship. We also validate our results against a manual bibliographic analysis of a counterfeit early edition of Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan (1651) [27].

	abstract = {In the present essay, on Spenser’s orthography, we address the question of whether the orthography of Spenser’s texts, in early modern editions, is salient and therefore worth preserving in modern editions. Even when we face the bibliographic fact that Spenser’s texts seem not to have been regarded as so valuably idiosyncratic that early modern printers preserved them from adjustment, we may still seek to know whether the first editions of Spenser’s works are demonstrably and articulably idiosyncratic, whether orthographically, lexically, inflectionally, or syntactically. This essay formulates a method for statistically probing Spenser’s orthographic profile against what we demonstrate to be the variant, but coherent background of early printed English. We build a model of early modern orthographic change based on letter n-grams extracted from the 60,000 texts in the EEBO-TCP corpus. The n-grams yield some 30,000 features; we concentrate on a subset of the 200 most variant features, reducing the dimensionality of the data by means of principal component analysis (PCA). Situating Spenser’s texts against contemporary and near-contemporary texts, we demonstrate that, in general, Spenser’s corpus is not orthographically distinctive and propose that the impression of the linguistic distinctiveness of Spenser’s poetry is concentrated elsewhere. We conclude both with proposals for new tests that might enable us to isolate that distinctiveness and with a brief assessment of appropriate editorial responses to our investigations.},

According to Fredson Bowers, writing in Shakespeare Quarterly in 1951, we will never know the printer of that section “until we know everything there is to be learned about seventeenth-century types.”2 Bowers doubted we could ever list the full set of F4’s printers because F4 was printed anonymously, and the volume left few clues about its printers. While George Watson Cole’s 1909 “examination of the letterpress show[ed] that a copy of the Third Folio was apparently broken into three portions and sent to three different printers,” Bowers himself only got as far as attributing the first of F4’s three separately paginated parts.3 The purpose of this note is to identify the other two printers involved in F4, one of whom, John Macock, was the printer whose shop was responsible for F4’s Hamlet. Regrettably, this short note does not include everything there is to be learned about seventeenth-century types.4},

We focus on clustering extracted glyph images into underlying templates in the presence of multiple confounding sources of variance. Our approach introduces a neural editor model that first generates well-understood printing phenomena like spatial perturbations from template parameters via interpertable latent variables, and then modifies the result by generating a non-interpretable latent vector responsible for inking variations, jitter, noise from the archiving process, and other unforeseen phenomena associated with Early Modern printing. Critically, by introducing an inference network whose input is restricted to the visual residual between the observation and the interpretably-modified template, we are able to control and isolate what the vector-valued latent variable captures. We show that our approach outperforms rigid interpretable clustering baselines (Ocular) and overly-flexible deep generative models (VAE) alike on the task of completely unsupervised discovery of typefaces in mixed-font documents.},

Riffing on this dramatic habit, Frisco verbally maps out an absurd landscape.
