# Letters

In this section I'm referring to individual characters in printed type, not correspondence! But there's lots of great computational work on early modern correspondence that I may add at a later time.

## Sample Research Questions

- Can we discover who printed a text based on damaged pieces of type?
- Does Spenser's spelling indicate a distinct use of archaism?
- Can different letterforms and damages be detected algorithimically?
