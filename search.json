    "text": "Introduction\nThis mini-site is a guide for my 4-day Dream Lab 2025 course, Digital Approaches to Early Modern Books. But I hope it will be useful for anyone who’s looking to apply digital and computational methods to 16th- and 17th-century print culture. Like the course, the site focuses more on existing tools and websites, but there’s also a little bit of code and visualization.\nRather than organize things by method or approach, I’ve sorted tools and methods by the parts of print culture a scholar is likely to have questions about: words, books, letters, people, ideas, etc. Naturally these categories are deeply intertwined and overlapping, and they’re not intended to be comprehensive. The goal is to help folks who are just starting out with digital approaches discover how to ask and answer questions about the research subjects they care about.\nWe’ve all had the experience of visiting an amazing new website, taking a tutorial on a new technique, or seeing an incredible presentation and thinking, “Wow, that’s cool! But how do I use it to help with what I’m working on?” We recognize the new method as useful even as we don’t know what we’d use it for. This site is meant to help fill in that gap.\nThe cover image is a nearly illegible letter B from Paul Franck’s Kunstrichtige Schreibart, or The Proper Art of Writing (1655), courtesy of The Public Domain Review, the Internet Archive, and The Getty. I like that it also looks like a bit like a heart!",

    "text": "1.3 Activities\n\n1.3.1 Digitization\n\nGo to the Internet Archive pages for Early English Books: 1475–1640 or 1641–1700\nSelect a topic that interests you, and search for a book that matches that topic.\nSelect a book and choose an interesting page (just one page, or even less!). For a fun challenge, you might choose a page that has more than just a single block of prose text. Maybe your page has a poem or a song. Maybe it has multiple columns, or even a table or diagram.\nFollow the guide to create an XML representation of that page or part of the page\n\n\nRead over parts of the introduction to XML here (you only need to read v.1-3 and v.6): https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html. You can also use the TEI By Example tutorial.\nOnce you have you a sense of XML, you can mark up your text in whatever way you see fit. Feel free to make up whatever elements and attributes you like. For a good example, look over the poem in section v.3, highlighted in pink.\nYou can use any plaintext editor for this, such as Brackets: https://brackets.io/.\nAsk lots of questions. Again, the goal is to get a feel for how this works rather than create a perfect object. If your page is very long, you can choose just one part to represent.\n\n\nThink about what is gained and what is lost in this representation vs. the digital image vs. the physical book itself (which you’ve never seen!).\nCompare your XML to the TCP version and the EarlyPrint version. You can find both at: https://earlyprint.org/download",

If the places in one interface were represented in another, how would that change our “reading” of that location?\nUsing Corpus Search, try to find the names of one or more of the locations in these tools somewhere in the EarlyPrint corpus. What are the difficulties of locating place names? How is it similar or different from finding the names of people?\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Encoding Places\n\nThe Map of Early Modern London uses XML to encode its places. Read over the short summary of their XML types and browse some of the different documents.\nFor discussion, consider how these are similar or different from the types of XML we worked with in the TCP and EarlyPrint texts, as well as the one your made yourself.",
