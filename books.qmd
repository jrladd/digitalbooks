# Books

For the purposes of this site, I'm defining a book as a unit of printed output. This could be a traditional printed book, but it could also be a broadside, pamphlet, news sheet, or other piece of printed ephemera. Books are distinct in this schema from texts: a book can be made up of many individual texts.
