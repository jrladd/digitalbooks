# Books

For the purposes of this site, I'm defining a book as a unit of printed output. This could be a traditional printed book, but it could also be a broadside, pamphlet, news sheet, or other piece of printed ephemera. Books are distinct from texts in this schema: a book can be made up of many individual texts.

## Sample Research Questions

- How does digitization transform a book?
- What is lost in the process(es) of digitization?
- Who made a book, and through what processes?
